schedulr
========

[Demo](http://bmuenzenmeyer.github.io/schedulr/src/index.html)

A dead-simple schedule creator for small businesses - used to learn more about angularjs

###Usage
Right now, schedulr will create a printable schedule off of a given date. If you go more than 7 days, wrapping may occur, but I've targeted the defaults to fit on a landscape-oriented sheet of 8.5" by 11" paper.

###Roadmap
1. Track hours by employee
2. Track total hours
3. Shift types
4. Mobile?
5. Persistence using local storage
