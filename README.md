schedulr
========

[Demo](https://simpleshiftscheduler.netlify.app/)

A dead-simple schedule creator for small businesses built with angularjs

###Features
1. Dead simple drag and drop
2. Configurable starting day and total days
3. Optional shift description (Cook, Waitress, Bus Route #2, etc.)
4. Track total hours by employee. Warns you over 40 hours
+. Printable with empty day columns

###Sizing
Right now, schedulr will create a printable schedule off of a given date. If you go more than 7 days, wrapping may occur, but I've targeted the defaults to fit on a landscape-oriented sheet of 8.5" by 11" paper.

###Roadmap
1. Persistence using local storage
