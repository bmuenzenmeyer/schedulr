schedulr
========

A dead-simple schedule creator for small businesses - used to learn more about angularjs

###Usage
Right now, schedulr will create a printable schedule off of a given date. If you go more than 7 days, wrapping may occur, but I've targeted the defaults to fit on a landscape-oriented sheet of 8.5" by 11" paper.

###Roadmap
1. Add shifts and assign employees
2. Track hours by employee
3. Track total hours
4. Shift types
